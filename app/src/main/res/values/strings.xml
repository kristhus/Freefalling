    <string name="about_text">
        We in Mandroid studio are an almost independent group
        of software associates that have tried to create a game.
        Our goal is to not to deny the story but to defy the ending.
        This will be accomplished by using synergetic design paradigms with a complex base.
        We believe that to live a creative life,
        one must lose their fear of being wrong and have tried to incorporate this in our game.
